Used to calculate the radiative heat transfer between parallel surfaces. 

Runs in JULIA.

The current working example assumes a Silicon hot material transfering radiation to InAs based thermophotovoltaics.


Run the spectral_HeatTransfer_Zbig to output spectral heat transfer data.

Run singleWorker_v2 to simulate the total above bandgap photons and total power.
